Genetic algorithm is commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspire operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. 

A person in the maze game(7x7) tries various paths to reach the destination with the given start point and the maze. In the process of reaching the endpoint, the next step will be decided by mutation, crossover and selection until the optimal path is found.
